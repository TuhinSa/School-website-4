				<p class="text muted">At Pathways, we encourage a love for reading, both for the sheer joy of it and because it is the most useful technological tool in the student's range of skills. Our Libraries not only have a vast range of tangible books but go beyond; offering digital media content, online databases, films and e-books. Each Library also houses quiet story-telling corners. Our state-of-the-art Library Management Software provides student access to the library resources online.The library facility is at the heart of our school community. It enables, encourages and empowers teaching and learning for all members of the school community. The role of the library is to provide a dynamic and flexible space that is innovatively designed with best practices and research in mind where students can explore and use various resources in different formats. They are encouraged to grow and become passionate learners and individuals where the world of knowledge opens up to them. The available resources offer an amazing variety of learning experiences for all ages as it comes from a variety of sources, within India and abroad.At Pathways, we have a dedicated library for Primary students that is more colourful and designed to appeal to young minds. We have a separate library for senior and middle school.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Weekly Boarding
					An ideal for nuclear families and working parents who are busy through the week. Children leave for their homes after classes on Friday afternoon and return to the Residences on Sunday evening. They get to avail the best of both – the school throughout the week with all the activities that the school has to offer; at the same time being home for the weekends and spend time with their families.

					Fortnightly Boarding
					Several parents living in the hinterland of NCR opt for this option. While taking their children out each week may not be possible or desirable, they do so every other week. This lets the students experience the range of activities planned for boarders over the weekends, while also spending time with their families.

					Term Boarding
					The traditional boarding format, experienced in a modern way. Our term boarders are at the very core of the Pathways Residential experience. From fun trips and expeditions to hikes, hobbies and cook-outs, our boarders come to regard the school as their second home. This is also a great transition for students who plan to pursue higher studies in International Universities.

					It is interesting to note that several weekly and fortnightly boarders often stay back during their weekend to enjoy the planned activities with their fellow boarders.</p>

				<h4>Sports</h4>
				<img src="https://www.pathways.in/assets/img/landing-7.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
				<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">We at Pathways, encourage students to participate in sports activities for enjoyment, relaxation and exercise. Sports are a positive aid to educational development and are imperative for the formation of a sense of self-worth in an individual. Sports also play a key role in building gamesmanship and team spirit. Every student is an ambassador of the true spirit of Pathways – on and off the field. Students get an opportunity to experiment with a variety of sports that they wish to pursue, both to excel in or as a hobby.
